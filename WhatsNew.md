  * Updated the [technical guide](TechnicalGuide.md). Now, it contains the passive tracer equation and its numerical scheme. Also features robust mathematical fundaments for fluid physics. Still misses the full listing of numerical schemes of the diagnostic variables. Could use a logical transition from the mathematical fundaments to the actual shallow-waters equations. In a future edition...

  * Created the [what's new](WhatsNew.md) wiki entry.
  * Created the wiki entry [How to add a new property?](DevHowtoAddNewDiagnosticVar.md).
  * Added the Diagnostic quantities section in the [technical guide](TechnicalGuide.md).
  * Improved poor graphics in the [technical guide](TechnicalGuide.md). The mesh figures now look much better.

  * The SHEL project hosted on the googlecode page was built in roughly 3 days.
  * On day 1, the technical guide was built, taken from a whole chapter from my [phd thesis](http://drop.io/phd_griflet). Also, the googlecode page was created on the first day and only featured the technical guide to [download](http://code.google.com/p/shel/downloads/list). Later on the 2nd day, a [wiki entry](TechnicalGuide.md) was created refering to the technical guide.
  * On day 2, I uploaded the code, added a GPL license, created a downloadble software package and created the first wiki entries. I also started the [user's guide](UsersManual.md).
  * On day 3, I finished the first version of the [user's guide](UsersManual.md), wrote the [template's descriptions](TemplatesDescription.md), wrote the first version of the [developer's guide](DevelopersManual.md) and also included youtube videos on the [template's descriptions](TemplatesDescription.md). Finally, I annotated the youtube videos with a link to the googlecode page of the SHEL project.
