= Getting started =
==Pre-requisites==
 * A recent version of Matlab must be installed in the machine meant to run the SHEL software. Currently, matlab version 2009b is being used as the development main machine for the SHEL software, but possibly older versions of matlab will work as well.
 * A Pentium 4 with 1 GB of RAM, or more, and at least 100 MB of available disk space.

==Software access==
 * The SHEL software package (composed of the source code and some matlab data files) is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/downloads/list downloads section] or get the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/source/checkout subversion repository].
 * To become an active developer and submit changes to the SHEL project please contact the project owner and a developer account will be provided.
 * Unpack the SHEL software package in a convenient work folder. A few tens of megabytes available should be enough.

==Others==
 * A [TechnicalGuide technical documentation] comes along with the software package in a separate download. It is recommended to download it as well.

= Quick-start =
 * Download and unzip the latest matlab package available in the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/downloads/list downloads section] or get the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/source/checkout subversion repository].
 * Open the Matlab environment and set the working folder where the m-files were unpacked.
 * Type 'launch' and and press enter at the matlab prompt.
 * Select a mat-file in the 'initial-conditions' folder and open it.
 * Change the parameters at will.
 * Select two or four-panel view and click the 'show' button.
 * Click the 'run' button to run the model (eventually enable the 'film' option').
 * To export graphics: select a format (eps, png or avi) and a view (all, level, velocity, left or right) from the dropdown menu, then give it a name in the textbox and click  the 'Print' button. If it is the current view only, make sure that the 'film' checkbox is unchecked.

= Installation =
 * Simply unpack the SHEL software package in the work-folder of choice.
 * Open the Matlab environment.
 * Set the path to the work folder where the SHEL software was installed.
 * Type _launch_ from the command line and press _enter_. The control panel will show up.

== The control panel ==

=== Physical processes ===
 * *use Coriolis*: activates the Coriolis acceleration term in the momentum equations ie makes the reference frame a rotating reference with the same angular velocity than what is felt at Earths's latitude, given in the _latitude_ parameter, in the _Physics parameters_ panel.
 * *use wind*: activates the wind stress term in the momentum equations. The wind stress is calculated from the wind speed field, given in the _uwind_ and _vwind_ parameters in the _Physics parameters_ panel.
 * *use pressure force*: activates the pressure force due to the elevation gradient. Its mathematical description is provided in the technical guide, available in the [Downloads download section].

= How to =
== Load a configuration ==
 * From the control panel click the _load_ button, or from the matlab command line prompt, type _launch_ and press _enter_. It will load the _control panel_.
 * Then choose a saved configuration file (with a .mat extension). By default, a few configuration samples come built-in with the SHEL software package in the _initial conditions_ folder. Click on _open_.

== Visualize a configuration ==
 * To visualize a loaded configuration, select one of the _two_ or the _four_ radio-button (enabling the two-panel or the four-panel view), then click on button _show_.
http://content.screencast.com/users/GRiflet/folders/Jing/media/be7de457-a970-4a61-b3de-4972e898a7bc/controlpanel-show.png
 * In the _view panels_, the user can run the model, select other views (if on the four-view panel), select the scale, reset the model to the initial instant and export the results in image files or avi movie file.

== Run the model ==
 * Click on the _reset_ button at any time to reload the initial instant of the loaded configuration.
 * Click on the _run_ button to compute all the time instants (intervalled by the _dt_ parameter set in the _dt_ textbox in the _control panel_). If the _film_ checkbox is checked, then every _output dt_ (a parameter set in the _output dt_ textbox, in the _control panel_), the simulation results will be printed onscreen in the two-panel or the four-panel views. Graphical output may slow down considerably the simulation and depends on the machine hardware (which gpu, which cpu, ...). Thus, to speed up the simulation duration, simply uncheck the _film_ checkbox at any time.
 * The simulation will last a simulated duration equal to the value set in the _time duration_ textbox, in the _control panel_. Then, it will graphically display the last computed instant in the _view panels_, whether the _film_ checkbox is or is not checked.

== Export graphics and movies ==
To help users to produce paper-standard captions, it is possible to export results in both vectorial and raster formats, respectively *eps* and *png*. It is also possible to export in *avi* movie format.
 # Insert a name near the _print_ button textbox. It will create a new folder in the _image-results_ work folder, with that name, where it will place all subsequent images and movies.
 # Select which variables to display from the drop down menus, _left property_ and _right property_ (in the four-panel view only).
 # Set the scale of each view with the respective _scale slider_.
 # Rotate and adjust the zooming of the camera, for each view, by hitting the _rotate 3D_ icon in the top _menubar_.
 # Select which view and which format to print from the dropdown menu, near the _reset_ button. Each view of the two(_level_, _velocity_), or four (_left_, _right_), available views is selectable. Alternatively, the whole views are selectable (_all_). The available output formats are *png* (raster), *eps* (vectorial) or *avi* (movie).

 # Optionally, if the _film_ checkbox is checked then a simulation will be continued and will last for the whole _time duration_, set in the _control panel_, and each _output dt_ will be exported in the chosen media format. Note that for *avi*, the _film_ checkbox will automatically be set and should not be unchecked during the frame scraping. If the _film_ checkbox is unchecked, then only what is currently displayed on the view panels will be exported.
 # To export the graphics click on the _print_ button then wait while the process takes place. It may take some time depending on the format (*png* are the slowest), the type of view and if the _film_ checkbox is set.

 # After the process of exporting the graphics took place, the newly saved graphics are found in the _image-results_ folder, in the sub-folder with the same name given in the textbox near the _print_ button.
 # Remember: 
  # because it is very important for the user to reproduce the same results (and the same graphics) at a later stage, both the _control panel_ configuration is saved, along with the _view panels_ settings, in a mat-file with the same name and in the same sub-folder. This allows the user to re-open the exact same configuration, and view settings, during another matlab session. 
  # Additionally, the one-dimensional integrated diagnostics time-series (integrated energy, vorticity, etc...) are also kept in a mat-file with the same name, added with the suffix _global_. This allows the user to re-plot the time-series, later, accordingly to the editorial standards of a given journal.

== Edit and save a new configuration ==
To save a new configuration (from the _control panel_):
 # Edit the parameters in the _control panel_ GUI.
 # Eventually (advanced users only), use the matlab debug tool to manually edit the bathymetry matrix and the initial conditions matrices.
 # Click the _save_ button in the _control panel_.
 # From the new dialog box, select the folder _initial-conditions_.
 # In the textbox, insert a name for the new configuration.
 # Click the _save_ button of the dialog box.

Alternatively, it was seen, in the section _[#Export_graphics_and_movies how to export graphics and movies]_, how to save the configuration, in the _control panel_, along with the settings, in the _views panel_, all in the same folder than of the graphics.
