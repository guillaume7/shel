= Getting started =
==Pre-requisites==
 * A recent version of Matlab must be installed in the machine meant to run the SHEL software. Currently, matlab version 2009b is being used as the development main machine for the SHEL software, but possibly older versions of matlab will work as well.
 * A Pentium 4 with 1 GB of RAM, or more, and at least 100 MB of available disk space.

==Software access==
 * The SHEL software package (composed of the source code and some matlab data files) is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/downloads/list downloads section] or get the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/source/checkout subversion repository].
 * To become an active developer and submit changes to the SHEL project please contact the project owner and a developer account will be provided.
 * Unpack the SHEL software package in a convenient work folder. A few tens of megabytes available should be enough.

==Others==
 * A [TechnicalGuide technical documentation] comes along with the software package in a separate download. It is recommended to download it as well.

= Quick-start =
 * Download and unzip the latest matlab package available in the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/downloads/list downloads section] or get the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/shel/source/checkout subversion repository].
 * Open the Matlab environment and set the working folder where the m-files were unpacked.
 * Type 'launch' and and press enter at the matlab prompt.
 * Select a mat-file in the 'initial-conditions' folder and open it.
 * Change the parameters at will.
 * Select two or four-panel view and click the 'show' button.
 * Click the 'run' button to run the model (eventually enable the 'film' option').
 * To export graphics: select a format (eps, png or avi) and a view (all, level, velocity, left or right) from the dropdown menu, then give it a name in the textbox and click  the 'Print' button. If it is the current view only, make sure that the 'film' checkbox is unchecked.

= Installation =
 * Simply unpack the SHEL software package in the work-folder of choice.
 * Open the Matlab environment.
 * Set the path to the work folder where the SHEL software was installed.
 * Type _launch_ from the command line and press _enter_. The control panel will show up.

= Loading a configuration =
 * From the control panel click the _load_ button, or from the matlab command line prompt, type _launch_ and press _enter_.

 * Then choose a saved configuration file (with a .mat extension). By default, a few configuration samples come built-in with the SHEL software package in the _initial conditions_ folder. Click on _open_.
