#summary Developer How-To: Add a new diagnostic variable in the property list

_Often, the user needs to compute a new diagnostic quantity, one that is not available on the current [UsersManual#Property_list _property list_]. Hence, this tutorial serves to guide the user to become a developer, and to help him create new diagnostic quantities in the SHEL. The developer is also encouraged to submit new quantities to this googlecode project._

In this tutorial, a dummy property, called `dummy1`, will be created.

 # *Determine which is the best suited grid type*: All properties are, eventually, interpolated on a [DevelopersManual#The_Arakawa_C_staggered_grids_matricial_design T-cell], for graphical rendering purposes. However this does not mean they are all computed on T-cells. This is the first important design step. Is this quantity naturally computed on T, U, V or W-cell grid? For example, the `curl` is a quantity naturally computed on the W-cell (see the [TechnicalGuide technical guide] for more details on the which grid cells are computed the properties). Thus, the global variable `curl_w` was [http://code.google.com/p/shel/source/browse/trunk/ComputeDiagnostics.m#233 computed on a W-cell and was later interpolated on a T-cell], to the global variable `curl_t`.
